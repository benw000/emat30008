    "- Learnt about github and framework for saving versions of code, I can see how this could be useful and a good way to work in a team setting\n",
    "- Set up VSCode with Jupyter notebooks and git, set up my first git repository\n",
    "- Learnt about .py files versus .ipynb, and how you can call functions and variables from different python files; this allows things to be modular and linear - could call other files into a py file and linearly construct more complicated things\n",
    "- Learnt about dictionaries and how they work, should become quite useful\n",
    "- Learnt how to use `break` and `continue` keywords, have always used flag variables and if statements before\n",

    "- Could run for step size h, then h/2, and compare results: if they're within some tolerance, say 10e-10 of eachother, then we can be confident our method is accurate. But this is inefficient\n",
    "- Instead use Butcher tableau, compare higher and lower order methods, adjust step size according to difference using formula. Since method is recursive, we can reuse lower order scheme calculations in higher order\n",
    "- Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg = ode45, used in solve.ivp as well as other things: We establish a desired tolerance, then dynamically alter the step size h at every step while solving, so that the error is just below the desired tolerance. But we increase the step size if it's too small, since we can make the code more efficient while still having the desired tolerance"
