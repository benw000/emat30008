But we increase the step size if it's too small, since we can make the code more efficient while still having the desired tolerance\n",

Through approximating space as a discrete set of points, and using a centred 2nd order scheme for the second derivative, we convert the 2nd order differential equation into a set of coupled linear equations, which can be written in matrix form and solved quickly using existing linear algebra packages like numpy. \n",
